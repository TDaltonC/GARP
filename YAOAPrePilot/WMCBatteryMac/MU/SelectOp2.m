% This program forms part of the Working Memory Capacity Battery, 
% written by Stephan Lewandowsky, Klaus Oberauer, Lee-Xieng Yang, and Ullrich Ecker. 
% The WMCBattery is available online at the website of the Cognitive Science
% Laboratories of the University of Western Australia's School of Psychology:

% Conditions of Use: Using the WMCBattery is free of charge but the authors 
% request that the associated paper be cited (add details later) 
% when publications arise out of data collection with the WMCBattery. 
% The authors do not guarantee the WMCBattery's functionality. 
% This task requires Matlab version 7.5 (2007b) or higher and the 
% Psychophysics Toolbox version 2.54 or 3.0.8.
